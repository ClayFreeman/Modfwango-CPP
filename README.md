Modfwango-C++
=============

Modfwango-C++ is an in-progress, feature-incomplete port of the
[Modfwango](http://modfwango.com) framework.  This repository is currently very
unstable, and APIs are likely to change.  When complete, this framework will be
the official C++ companion to the PHP edition.  The end goal is the same: to
provide an independent code base that can be compiled on any Linux distribution.
